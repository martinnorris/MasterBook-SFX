<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.1</code>Necroscope</h1>
<p>
The basic power of a Necroscope is to talk to the dead.  
Make the SFX ESP:Necroscope skill roll against the SFX DN (<code>Specific.getCostDN</code>).  
If you SFX roll succeeds add the amount you exceed the roll to the <i>effect</i> value ()<code>Effect.getValue</code>), 
compare to the spirit <code>Skill.getOpposition</code> and check the <code>Skill.getResult</code> column for the result.
There is a modifier for the result.  
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Situation</th><th>Modifier</th></tr>
<tr><td>Deceased is family or close relative</td><td>-3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deceased is an acquaintance</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deceased just wants to talk</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deceased knows and doesn't like Necroscope</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deceased knows and hates Necroscope</td><td>+3 or more</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A dead spirit can also act as a teacher to the Necroscope once a connection has been created.  
To learn requires a <i>teaching</i> roll on part of the spirit plus a ESP:Necroscope skill roll.
The difficulty of the SFX roll is the range value plus twice the number of skill adds to be learned.  
</p>
<p>
The Necroscope can <i>vector</i> the skills of a dead person once contact has been made.
The difference in the basis attribute for the skill between the Necroscope and the target is used to limit the number of skill adds that can be vectored 
and as a contribution to the DN.  e.g. a Necroscope with INT 10 vectoring a spirit with INT 12 can only vector the target's skill adds + 10 - 12
The DN is double the number of skill adds to be vectored plus the difference between attribute levels.
</p>
<p>
The Necroscope can <i>channel</i> the complete skill set of a dead spirit allowing them to use the target skills and abilities.
The difficulty of this is 10 + the ability and skill adds that are most appropriate 
</p>

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.2</code>Necromancer</h1>
<p>
Successful use of ESP:Necromancer allows the Necromancer to torture the secrets from the dead soul of the victim.  
Roll the skill with SFX DN (<code>Specific.getCostDN</code>).  
Compare the SFX <i>effect</i> (<code>Effect.getValue</code>) against <code>Skill.getOpposition</code> and consult the <code>Skill.getResult</code>.  
Success on this table reveals basic identity and basic biographical information.  
Modify the DN depending on the state of the body:
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>State</th><th>Modifier</th></tr>
<tr><td>Body dead &lt; 1 hour</td><td>-3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Body dead &lt; 6 hours</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Body dead &lt; 1 week</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Body dead &lt; 1 month</td><td>+3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Body dead &lt; 1 year</td><td>+6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Body completely rotted</td><td>+12</td></tr>
<tr><td>Additionally - body mummified or well preserved</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Additionally - surgical suite available</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Additionally - torture equipment available</td><td>-1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Subtract the victims <i>willpower</i> from the <i>effect</i> (<code>Effect.getValue</code>) and apply this result {positive or negative} to further uses of the ESP power.
A Necromancer can often tell if the deceased has something important they would not willingly divulge.  
The Necromancer makes an opposed SFX roll against the <i>willpower</i> of the dead, a success then allows the Necromancer to ferret out the information.  
The time and effort are from the paranormal investigation chart:
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Time</th><th>Information</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>instant</td><td>Immediate present, current thoughts</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>5 seconds</td><td>Something immediately to mind</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>30 seconds</td><td>Subject that happened or is remembered for current day</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>3 minutes</td><td>Important long term memory</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>10 minutes</td><td>Unimportant long term memory</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>1 hour</td><td>Important fact forgotten</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>3 hours</td><td>Unimportant forgotten fact</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>Within these categories the information is 100% truthful as far as the subject knows</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>There is no limit to the number of times the Necromancer can interrogate the victim</td></tr>
</table>

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.3</code>Prescient</h1>
<p>
You can see the future, sometimes flashes out of the blue, or sometimes when you make a subconscious connection.
These both work in a similar way, but in the first case the Game Master tells you when to test your power because of a story critical moment,
and in the second case you try to have a subconscious insight by association with words, images, touching something etc.,.  
The <i>effect</i> value (<code>Effect.getValue</code>) determines the time window you experience of <code>Effect.getValue.getTime</code> 
</p>
<p>
When the Game Master feels a serious event could occur within the Prescient time window, the player makes an ESP:Prescient SFX roll DN (<code>Specific.getCostDN</code>), 
modified by the severity of the event.  
On success subtract the DN from the Prescient skill total, and look up this value as time for the length of the vision - 0 = 1 seconds; 9 = 1 minute; 18 = 1 hour etc.,.
The length of the duration determines the level of detail the Prescient can extract from the vision
</p>
<p>
Free association is where the Prescient tries to trigger a vision by having someone recite words, or flash images, or even from touching something.
The Prescient makes the SFX roll DN (<code>Specific.getCostDN</code>), and a success generates the duration of the vision from skill minus the DN.  
In this case the Prescient takes shock damage equal to the amount the Prescient beat the DN roll.
For each test like this the DN increases by 1 until the Prescient fails a roll, and then they cannot try free association until the Game Master agrees.  
(Or optionally after the FV used as a delay) 
</p>

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.4</code>Seer</h1>
<p>
A Seer can see the lifelines of living, sentient creatures.  They perceive Humans and Wamphyrii life lines as different colours.  
In their perception of these lifelines the Seer sees how different lifelines have interacted in the past, and might interact in the future.  
The <i>effect</i> of the SFX gives the time (<code>Effect.getValue.getTime</code>) in the past <i>or</i> the future that the Seer can examine a lifelines.  
However a Seer can see multiple targets that could be the same person in the past <i>and</i> the future.  
To visualise interactions with other people the Seer needs an SFX that applies to multiple subjects.  
</p>
<p>
The Seer makes the SFX skill roll ESP:Seer with DN (<code>Specific.getCostDN</code>) to determine how much (if anything) the Seer will reveal.  
For each point of the roll that beats the DN, the Seer learns 1 fact about the target
When the lifeline of a person interacts with another unknown lifeline, the other lifeline can only be identified for certain is if  
the lifeline is for a person who is both within visual range and the range of the ESP power, plus within the effect range {time} of the SFX.  
The Seer can see the termination of a lifeline as it ceases, if that is within the time window of the SFX, and has some idea about the cause of death.
</p> 
<p>
The lifeline of a person being 'reborn' as a Wamphyri has the termination associated with death, and then some time later the emergence of a fainter Wamphyri coloured lifeline.
</p>

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.5</code>Sensitive</h1>
<p>
Sensitives are ESP users who are attuned to a particular type of matter or energy, spiritual or tangible.  
The Sensitive SFX is used to determine the quantity and qualities of the target.  
The SFX is worked 'in reverse' using the attributes of the target to determine the effectiveness of the Sensitive.  
First roll the Sensitive's ESP:Sensitive skill against the SFX DN (<code>Specific.getCostDN</code>) and note the difference.  Even <i>negative</i> values could provide information.  
The success level is then applied to a formula that includes the target mass and range.  (For the mass and range use the equivalent value measure)
</p>
<p class="formula">
success = target mass - target range + SFX effect + difference noted above
</p>
<p>
Compare this value on the <code>Skill.getResult</code> column.  A negative result here indicates that the Sensitive cannot detect the target.  
A success will give a general idea of quantity, range and bearing; while a spectacular success gives detailed information about the target.
Range does affect the level of detail discovered.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally the Sensitive will subconsciously detect something that is too big to miss.
In this case the Game Master will prompt the Sensitive if the source mass minus source range is more than 10
</p>

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.6</code>Shaman</h1>
<p>
A Shaman can cause actual physical harm to the target through spiritual means.
The Shaman rolls ESP:Shaman with DN ()<code>Specific.getCostDN</code>).  
If this roll succeeds compare the <i>effect</i> (<code>Effect.getValue</code>) of the SFX against the appropriate target <i>attribute</i> and consult the <code>Skill.getResult</code> column.
After this result the Shaman suffers shock, this is calculated as half the <i>effect</i> (<code>Effect.getValue</code>) minus the Shaman's <i>confidence</i>; 
and if the SFX roll exceeded double the <i>effect</i> reduced by SFX roll minus <i>effect</i>.  
</p>
<p class="formula">
shock = (effect of SFX - CON)/2 - roll > (2 * effect of SFX) ? (effect of SFX - roll) : 0
</p>
<p>
A Shaman may use the SFX as long as they stay conscious, but these should be at different targets.  
Use the <i>push</i> rules instead of making several SFX on the same target but this is more dangerous.  
If the accumulated shock from using the SFX is greater than the Shaman's shock limit, the excess shock is converted to wounds  
</p>
<p>
The damage caused by the Shaman is not typical physical damage, but is expressed as numerous minor injures or psychosomatic signs.
The target of a Shaman's attack is fully aware of the source of the attack even if they do understand the nature.
</p>

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.7</code>Spotter</h1>
<p>
A Spotter can detect if another person has an ESP power.  
The power is 'on' all the time, so the Game Master can ask the Spotter to make a test for anyone they meet.  
The SFX is rolled using the characters ESP:Spotter skill with DN (<code>Specific.getCostDN</code>) with a bonus of the DN minus the range value.
{This makes it harder to spot ESP users further away}
If the Spotter succeeds on the roll, take the <i>effect</i> (<code>Effect.getValue</code>) minus the range value and compare the result on the <code>Skill.getResult</code> column.  
A minimal success identifies the person as an ESP user and recognisable as such in the future like a psychic fingerprint
A spectacular success reveals the particular ESP power, their ESP skill level and SFX effect value.
</p>
<p>
A Spotter will also spot the taint of Wamphyri {even if they do not have a ESP power}.
Use the Wamphyri <i>willpower</i> minus the range, instead of the <i>effect</i> minus range, for the bonus to the ESP:Spotter roll.  
</p>

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.8</code>Telepath</h1>
<p>
Using their ESP:Telepath skill a Telepath can directly interrogate a subjects mind without any interference from lies and dissemination.  
A Telepath needs to know exactly where the target is located {from sight of the target or specific knowledge} or have an area or volume of effect factor in the SFX.  
Make the SFX ESP:Telepath skill roll against the DN <code>Specific.getCostDN</code>.
The number by which the skill roll exceeded the DN is used as a bonus for the Telepath's interrogation attempts.  
If the skill roll is more than twice the DN (<code>Specific.getCostDN.mul.2U</code>) then add anything more than twice the DN as a modifier to the interrogation
</p>
<p>
The Telepath then has the <i>effect</i> (<code>Effect.getValue</code>) as time of <code>Effect.getValue.getTime</code> to interrogate the target.  
For each question the Telepath rolls her ESP:Telepath skill check with the bonus above.  
Add any modifier if the initial contact attempt was very successful.  
Compare this result to the value in the paranormal interrogation table for the type of information required.  
Move the value by the difference of the roll so success reduces the value and the time taken, while failure increases the value and time taken.
The information gained is always truthful.  
When time begins to run out then the Telepath can <i>push</i> using normal push rules.  
While interrogating a target the Telepath can often accidentally pick up other surface thoughts of the person as the Game Master requires.

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.9</code>Numerancer</h1>

<h1><code>Skill.getCost.eq.10</code>Witch - Self</h1>
<p>
A Witch uses sympathetic magic to affect her or his self.  
This is a psychoactive application that modifies an <i>attribute</i> or <i>skill</i> or <i>property</i> of the Witch.  
</p>
<p>
The SFX needs to be <i>focused</i> so that once it affects the witch the effect is maintained.  
Generally a component is required that is relevant to the sympathetic effect required.  
</p>
<p>
A witch activates the SFX by rolling her ESP:Witch skill against DN <code>Specific.getCostDN</code>.  
Then the <i>effect</i> (<code>Effect.getValue</code>) of the SFX is compared against the appropriate target <i>attribute</i>, 
and the <code>Skill.getResult</code> column is consulted for the result.
</p>

<h1>SFX build</h1>
<p>
Your SFX power has these properties:
</p>

<h3><code>Effect.hasCost</code>Effect</h3>
<p>The effect of the SFX is <code>Effect.getValue</code> (<code>Effect.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Range.hasCost</code>Range</h3>
<p>Range for the effect is <code>Range.getValueUnit</code> (<code>Range.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Speed.isDefault</code>Speed linked to Range</h3>
<p>The speed of the effect is linked to the range so it takes 1 round</p>

<h3><code>Speed.hasCost</code>Speed</h3>
<p>The speed of the effect is <code>Speed.getValueUnit</code> (<code>Speed.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Duration.hasCost</code>Duration</h3>
<p>The effect will last <code>Duration.getValueUnit</code> (<code>Duration.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Casting.hasCost</code>Casting time</h3>
<p>It takes <code>Casting.getValueUnit</code> to create the effect (-<code>Casting.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>AreaEffect.Area.hasCost</code>Area Effect</h3>
<p>The effect is applies across an area that is <code>AreaEffect.Area.getValue</code>m<sup>2</sup> (<code>AreaEffect.Area.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>AreaEffect.Volume.hasCost</code>Area Effect</h3>
<p>The effect is applies to anything in a volume <code>AreaEffect.Volume.getValue</code>m<sup>3</sup> (<code>AreaEffect.Volume.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>AreaEffect.Shape.getIndex.eq.1</code>Area Effect</h3>
<p>The effect is applied to anything in a single shape (<code>AreaEffect.Shape.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>AreaEffect.Shape.getIndex.eq.2</code>Area Effect</h3>
<p>The effect is applied to any (reasonable) shape (<code>AreaEffect.Shape.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>AreaEffect.Shape.getIndex.eq.3</code>Area Effect</h3>
<p>The effect is applied to a shape that deforms during the effect (<code>AreaEffect.Shape.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>MultiTarget.hasCost</code>Multiple Targets</h3>
<p>You can effect <code>MultiTarget.getValue</code> different targets (<code>MultiTarget.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>MultiAttribute.hasCost</code>Multiple Attributes</h3>
<p>The SFX applies damage to <code>MultiAttribute.getUnit</code> (<code>MultiAttribute.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>ChangeTarget.hasCost</code>Change Targets</h3>
<p>During the effect you can change <code>ChangeTarget.getValue</code> target (<code>ChangeTarget.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>VariableEffect.hasCost</code>Variable Effect</h3>
<p>When applying the effect you can change the effect value by <code>VariableEffect.getValue</code> (<code>VariableEffect.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>VariableDuration.Switch.hasCost</code>Control Duration</h3>
<p>While the effect is in progress you can control the effect as <code>VariableDuration.Switch.getUnit</code> (<code>VariableDuration.Switch.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>VariableDuration.Extend.hasCost</code>Variable Duration</h3>
<p>Before applying the effect you can change the duration by <code>VariableDuration.Extend.getValueUnit</code> (<code>VariableDuration.Extend.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Apportation.ToHit.hasCost</code>'To Hit' Bonus</h3>
<p>The effect requires a 'to hit' roll to impact the target, and this SFX has a bonus of <code>Apportation.ToHit.getValue</code> for that roll (<code>Apportation.ToHit.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Apportation.Move.hasCost</code>Apportation - Moving the Effect</h3>
<p>Once the effect is in progress it can be provide impetus to the target.  
For example a <code>Apportation.Move.getValueUnit</code> can be moved at <code>Apportation.Move.getMove</code> (<code>Apportation.Move.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Maintenance.hasCost</code>Maintain the Effect</h3>
<p>The effect can be maintained at the end of the duration by making the SFX roll DN <code>Total.getCostDN.div.3U</code>.
You suffer an addition FV of <code>Total.getCostFV.div.2U</code>.
The duration is again <code>Duration.getValueUnit</code> but there is no additional casting time.
If there are modifiers then they might apply to a lesser extent for the maintenance. (<code>Maintenance.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Focus.hasCost</code>Focused</h3>
<p>Once the effect is in progress on a target then the effect follows the target.  
If the SFX has multiple targets they are all focused. (<code>Focus.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Charges.hasCost</code>Charges</h3>
<p>The effect is stored in an object.  Releasing the effect is either at will, or requires a skill roll depending on other factors (see Related Skill or 'to hit').  
The object that holds the charges is a general type of object, unless there is a specific component specified (see Components).  (<code>Charges.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Charges.getBonus.gt.0</code>Ward</h3>
<p>The charges are in the form of a ward.  This is a charge that can automatically trigger unattended in the right circumstances.  
The circumstances for the ward to trigger are defined when the effects are charged.  
The difference of the SFX roll above the DN <code>Total.getCostDN</code> is the <i>perception</i> skill total for the ward.  
When the ward should be triggered the Game Master assigns a DN for the ward to perceive the situation and trigger, (typically <i>easy</i>), 
though characters could <i>stealth</i> their way past the ward (Cost included in Charges)</p>

<h3><code>Community.getChildren.eq.1</code>Community</h3>
<p>To perform the SFX you need a community of <code>Community.Community.getTable</code> 
people to perform a <code>Community.Community.getUnit</code> task in conjunction.  (-<code>Community.Community.getCostReduction</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Community.getChildren.gt.1</code>Communities</h3>
<p>You need to coordinate several communities for the effect to work</p>
<p><code>Community.*.getTable</code> people to perform a <code>Community.*.getUnit</code> task in conjunction.  (-<code>Community.*.getCostReduction</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Components.getChildren.eq.1</code>Component</h3>
<p>This SFX requires a component that is '<code>Components.Component.getUnit</code>' {<code>Components.Component.getTable</code>} 
<code>Components.Component.getBonus.show.which is destroyed</code> (-<code>Components.Component.getCostReduction</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Components.getChildren.gt.1</code>Components</h3>
<p>There are several components that are required to make this SFX work</p>
<p>'<code>Components.*.getUnit</code>' {<code>Components.*.getTable</code>} <code>Components.*.getBonus.show.which is destroyed</code> (-<code>Components.*.getCostReduction</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Concentration.getCostReduction.gt.0</code>Concentration</h3>
<p>You must concentrate for <code>Concentration.getValueUnit</code> to perform the SFX.  
Test against <i>willpower</i> <code>Concentration.getComment</code> to see if you are distracted.  (-<code>Concentration.getCostReduction</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Gestures.getChildren.eq.1</code>Gesture</h3>
<p>As part of the SFX you need to make a gesture that is '<code>Gestures.Gesture.getUnit</code>' {<code>Gestures.Gesture.getTable</code>}.  
This is done by a <i>dexterity</i> check <code>Gestures.Gesture.getComment</code> (-<code>Gestures.Gesture.getCostReduction</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Gestures.getChildren.gt.2</code>Gestures</h3>
<p>You need to make the following gestures for the SFX.  Each requires a different <i>dexterity</i> test:</p>
<p>'<code>Gestures.*.getUnit</code>' {<code>Gestures.*.getTable</code>} check <code>Gestures.*.getComment</code> (-<code>Gestures.*.getCostReduction</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Incantation.hasCost</code>Incantation</h3>
<p>For the SFX you need to perform an incantation consisting of '<code>Incantation.getUnit</code>'.  
This requires a <i>mind</i> check <code>Incantation.getComment</code>.    
<code>Incantation.getBonus.show.It needs to be</code> 
<code>Incantation.getBonus.bit.1.show.foreign {check you have that ability}</code> 
<code>Incantation.getBonus.bit.2.show.loud</code> 
<code>Incantation.getBonus.bit.4.show.profane</code>  
(<code>Incantation.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>RelatedSkill.getCostReduction.gt.0</code>Related Skill</h3>
<p>To successfully trigger the effect you need to make a check <code>RelatedSkill.getComment</code>. (<code>RelatedSkill.getCostReduction</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Other.hasCost</code>Other Reductions</h3>
<p>There are changes for DN or FV that are not covered anywhere else on this sheet.  
You agree with the Game Master what is necessary for the SFX to obtain these changes.  (<code>Other.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Unreal.hasCost</code>Unreal</h3>
<p>The effect is <i>not</i> real.  This reduction gives the target of the effect a <i>intellect</i> attempt at DN
<code>Unreal.getSpecial</code> to disregard the effect.  This reduction is split <code>Unreal.getPercentage</code> between DN and FV.  (<code>Unreal.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Total.hasCost</code>Division between DN/FV</h3>
<p>The value calculated for the cost above is divided between difficulty number DN and feedback value FV  (<code>Fraction.getPercentage</code>) </p>

<h3><code>Total.hasCost</code>Totals</h3>
<p>The DN of the SFX test is <code>Total.getCostDN</code> and the FV is <code>Total.getCostFV</code></p>

<h1><code>Skill.hasCost</code>Additional factors for Necroscope background</h1>

<h3><code>ConcentrationAdd.hasCost</code>Isolation</h3>
<p>To be able to concentrate you must be completely isolated (<code>ConcentrationAdd.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Reception.hasCost</code>Reception</h3>
<p>When you use your ESP power the target has awareness with <code>Reception.getUnit</code>  (<code>Reception.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Trance.hasCost</code>Trance</h3>
<p>While you are using your ESP power you enter a trance.  The difficulty of breaking you out of the trance is <code>Trance.getUnit</code>.  
A Necroscope normally has the trance effect.  (<code>Trance.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Lock.hasCost</code>Lock</h3>
<p>While you are using your ESP power the target is 'locked'.  
They cannot perform any action until they make a <code>Lock.getUnit</code> skill check.  (<code>Lock.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Countenance.hasCost</code>Countenance</h3>
<p>While you are using your ESP power your appearance changes as seen by the target.  
This is a psychological effect but the target is 100% certain that you have exhibited signs that are <code>Countenance.getUnit</code>.  (<code>Countenance.getCost</code>)</p>

<h3><code>Specific.hasCost</code>Totals including the Necroscope changes</h3>
<p>
Taking into account the changes for Necroscope, the DN of the SFX test is <code>Specific.getCostDN</code> and the FV is <code>Specific.getCostFV</code>.  
Optionally either this FV equates to a delay time of <code>Specific.getCostFV</code> minutes before you can use the power again,  
or this FV means a delay time of <code>Specific.getCostFV.getTime</code> before you can use the power again.
</p>

<h3><code>Effect.getCost.gt.12</code>Effect</h3>
<p>
After the first application of the SFX against a target, use the difference of the effect and the target resistance as a modifier to any subsequent uses
</p>

<h3><code>Effect.getCost.lt.13</code>Effect</h3>
<p>
An effect value of at least 13 is suggested.  
After the first application of the SFX against a target, use the difference of the <i>effect</i> and the target resistance as a modifier to any subsequent uses
</p>

<h3><code>Speed.not.isDefault</code>Speed</h3>
<p>
Usually a Necroscope SFX speed is linked to the range so the SFX happens immediately in the same round.
This has a 0 cost.  You can choose to make the speed slower which gives you a reduction in the cost of the SFX. 
</p>

<h3><code>Charges.hasCost</code>Charges</h3>
<p>
This is not really allowed
</p>

<h3><code>Fraction.getValue.neq.0.5</code>Split DN and FV</h3>
<p>
Typically Necroscope suggests a split of DN/FV of 50%/50% and the FV is ignored.
An alternative is to allow a variable split as in the MasterBook rules, and to use the FV as a delay required between applications of the SFX.  
</p>

<h3><code>Community.hasCost</code>Community</h3>
<p>
All powers in Necroscope are individual
</p>

<h3><code>Components.getCost.eq.1</code>Components</h3>
<p>
Using a component for an SFX is a psychological placebo
</p>

<h3><code>Components.getCost.gt.1</code>Components</h3>
<p>
Using a component should be limited to a 1 point reduction
</p>

<h3><code>Incantation.getCost.gt.2</code>Incantation</h3>
<p>
Incantations should be limited to a few words or a mantra
<code>Incantation.getBonus.show.The incantation</code> 
<code>Incantation.getBonus.bit.1.show.could be foreign in a dead tongue, you should have a good reason for knowing and using that language</code> 
<code>Incantation.getBonus.bit.2.show.need not be loud</code> 
<code>Incantation.getBonus.bit.4.show.need not be profane!</code>  
</p>

<h3><code>Unreal.hasCost</code>Unreal</h3>
<p>
Only a Shaman can use this modifier.
The target makes an <i>intellect</i> attempt at DN <code>Unreal.getSpecial</code> to disregard the SFX.
